# 📦 Terraform Remote Backend Setup using S3 & DynamoDB

This README explains how to set up a **remote backend** in Terraform using **Amazon S3** for storing the state file and **DynamoDB** for state locking. This setup is highly recommended for team collaboration and production-grade infrastructure management.

---

## 📚 What is a Remote Backend?

In Terraform, a backend determines how state is loaded and how operations like `apply`, `plan`, etc., are executed. By default, Terraform uses a **local backend** where the state file is saved on your local machine. This can lead to issues in team environments or CI/CD pipelines.

A **remote backend**:
- Stores state securely and centrally (e.g., in S3)
- Enables **locking** using DynamoDB (avoids parallel execution issues)
- Helps with team collaboration and consistency

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following before setting up the remote backend:
- An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to create and access S3 and DynamoDB
- Terraform installed and configured (`terraform -version`)
- AWS CLI configured with credentials (`aws configure`)

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### 🔹 Step 1: Create Infrastructure for Backend

Manually or using Terraform, create:
- An **S3 bucket** to store the state files
- A **DynamoDB table** for state locking (with a primary key `LockID` of type `String`)

These resources must exist *before* using them in the backend configuration.

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure Remote Backend in Terraform

Create a `backend.tf` file (separate from your main Terraform config).  
Specify the:
- S3 bucket name
- Key (folder path and name for the state file inside the bucket)
- AWS region
- DynamoDB table name

> ⚠️ Do **not** include any resources in the same file as `terraform { backend "s3" { ... } }`.

After creating this file, run `terraform init`. Terraform will:
- Initialize the backend
- Prompt to migrate local state to the remote backend if a state file already exists

### 🔹 Step 3: Add a Test Resource (e.g., EC2)

To verify that the remote backend works:
- Add a small test resource like an EC2 instance
- Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
- Confirm the state file appears in the S3 bucket and locking happens in DynamoDB

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

- The state file (`terraform.tfstate`) will be stored inside the specified S3 bucket.
- Lock entries will be created in the DynamoDB table during `apply` to prevent simultaneous execution.
- Your local machine will no longer maintain a `.tfstate` file.

---

## 🔒 Security Tips

- Enable **versioning** on your S3 bucket for state recovery.
- Set **encryption** and restrict bucket access using IAM policies.
- Limit DynamoDB table access to only Terraform users.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive values in `backend.tf`; prefer environment variables or CI/CD secrets.
